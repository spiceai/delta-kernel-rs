# delta kernel mdbook

This book serves as a user guide + developer guide + overall docs for the kernel. In addition to our
docs.rs and top-level README, the three provide comprehensive documentation for the project.

## prerequisites

This book is built with [`mdbook`]. Install the latest version with `cargo install mdbook` or whatever
their latest docs say. If running into issues with the `mermaid` preprocessor (e.g. "Unable to run the preprocessor `mermaid`"), run `cargo install mdbook-mermaid`.

## building
The book is built in CI and deployed to [docs.delta.io/kernel/rust](https://docs.delta.io/kernel/rust/). When working on
the book locally you can preview changes with mdbook local server:

```bash
mdbook serve # from docs/user-guide to serve the book on localhost:3000
```
