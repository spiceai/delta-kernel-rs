# Building a connector: overview

A **connector** is the adapter layer between a **compute engine** (Spark, Flink, DuckDB,
Polars, DataFusion, or your own query engine) and Delta tables. This matters because
compute engines know nothing about the Delta protocol. They expose their own DataSource
APIs, and the connector translates those calls into Delta Kernel operations.

## The big picture

Every compute engine defines its own interfaces for reading and writing data. For example:

- **Apache Spark** has [DataSourceV2](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/Table.html):
  `Table`, `ScanBuilder`, `Scan`, `Batch`, `PartitionReader`, `WriteBuilder`, and others.
- **Apache Flink** has its Source/Sink APIs:
  `Source`, `SplitEnumerator`, `SourceReader`, `Sink`, `SinkWriter`, and others.
- **DuckDB** has its [Extension API](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview.html):
  `TableFunction`, `TableFunctionBindInput`, and others.

Building a Delta connector means implementing these compute-engine-specific interfaces and
using Delta Kernel to fulfill them:

## Example: how the Spark connector works

To make this concrete, here's how the
[Delta Spark connector](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/tree/master/spark) maps Spark's
DataSourceV2 interfaces to Kernel APIs:

| Spark DataSourceV2 interface | Connector class | Uses Kernel... |
|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| `Table` (entry point, schema, capabilities) | `SparkTable` | `Snapshot` for schema and metadata |
| `ScanBuilder` (filter pushdown, column pruning) | `SparkScanBuilder` | `ScanBuilder` with predicates and column selection |
| `Scan` (plan which files to read) | `SparkScan` | `Scan.getScanFiles()` to get the list of data files |
| `Batch` (partition files for parallel execution) | `SparkBatch` | Partitions scan files across Spark tasks |
| `PartitionReader` (read data from files) | `SparkPartitionReader` | Reads Parquet files assigned to this task |

The pattern is always the same: the compute engine asks for something through its DataSource
API, and the connector translates that into the corresponding Kernel call.

## The Snapshot is the center of everything

All connector operations start from a `Snapshot`, an immutable view of the table at a
specific version:

```rust,ignore
let snapshot = Snapshot::builder_for(table_url).build(&engine)?;
```

From a snapshot, you can:

| Operation | Kernel API | Typical DataSource equivalent |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Get schema and metadata | `snapshot.schema()`, `snapshot.table_properties()` | Table schema discovery |
| Read data | `snapshot.scan_builder()` | Scan / PartitionReader |
| Write data | `snapshot.transaction(committer, &engine)` | Writer / Committer |
| Checkpoint | `snapshot.create_checkpoint_writer(&engine)` | Maintenance task |

## What your connector does vs. what Kernel does

The key principle: **Kernel handles the Delta protocol, your connector handles execution.**

**Kernel handles:**
- Log replay (figuring out which files are active at a version)
- Data skipping (pruning files using statistics and predicates)
- Schema enforcement and column mapping
- Transaction conflict detection
- Protocol compliance (table features, reader/writer requirements)

**Your connector handles:**
- Implementing the compute engine's DataSource API
- Controlling parallelism and distribution (how many threads/tasks, which worker reads which file)
- Data format conversion (Kernel's `EngineData` to your engine's native format)
- Query planning integration (pushing filters and projections down to Kernel)
- Resource management (memory budgets, connection pooling)

## The Engine trait: pluggable I/O and compute

Kernel never does I/O directly. When it needs to list files, read Parquet, parse JSON, or
evaluate expressions, it calls into the `Engine` trait. This is where you can plug in your
engine's native implementations for maximum performance.

Kernel provides a `DefaultEngine` (Arrow + `object_store` + Tokio). Many connectors
start here and only replace specific handlers when they need better performance. See
[The Engine trait](../concepts/engine_trait.md) for details on the four required handlers
(`StorageHandler`, `JsonHandler`, `ParquetHandler`, `EvaluationHandler`) and the optional
`MetricsReporter`.

You need a custom `Engine` when:

- **Your engine has its own columnar data format** (not Arrow) and you want to avoid
  conversion overhead
- **Your engine has its own I/O layer** (e.g. a distributed file system client, encrypted
  storage, or custom caching)
- **You want engine-native expression evaluation** (e.g. vectorized execution, JIT
  compilation)

To use different cloud storage (S3, Azure, GCS), you do not need a custom engine.
`DefaultEngine` supports all `object_store` backends without modification.

## Getting started

Building a connector typically involves these steps:

1. **Choose or implement an Engine.** Start with `DefaultEngine` unless you have a reason
   not to. See [Implementing the Engine trait](./implementing_engine.md).

2. **Implement your DataSource's read interfaces** using Kernel's Scan API:
   - Create a `Snapshot` to discover the table schema and version
   - Use `ScanBuilder` to push down filters and column projections
   - Use `Scan` to get the list of files to read
   - Distribute those files across your engine's execution model
   - Read and transform data using the Engine
   - See [Building a scan](../reading/building_a_scan.md) and
     [Filter pushdown](../reading/filter_pushdown.md)

3. **Implement your DataSource's write interfaces** using Kernel's Transaction API:
   - Create a `Transaction` from a `Snapshot`
   - Write Parquet files and register them with the transaction
   - Commit atomically, handling conflicts and retries
   - See [Creating a table](../writing/create_table.md) and
     [Appending data](../writing/append.md)

4. **Handle distribution** (if your engine is distributed):
   - Serialize scan metadata and transaction state to ship to workers
   - Collect results from workers and commit on the driver
   - See [Advanced reads with scan_metadata()](../reading/scan_metadata.md)
